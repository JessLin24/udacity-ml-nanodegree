# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
This repo contains projects from the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree that I began in March 2019.

## 0_titanic_survival_exploration
Introduction to machine learning concepts to start off Nanodegree program. Create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age.


## 1_boston_housing
Apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

Concepts
- Data exploration (features and target variable)
- Performance metrics (R2 score)
- Split data (testing & training subsets)
- Performance graphs (learning and complexity curves)
- Train, optimize, and test model (grid-search and cross validation)

## 2_finding_donors
Apply supervised learning on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

Concetps
- Data exploration pre-processing (normalization, one-hot encoding)
- Evaluate supervised learners (metrics and naive predictor)
- Train, optimize, and test model (accuracy, f-score, feature selection)

## 3_customer_segments
Apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 

Concepts
- Data exploration and pre-processing (feature distribution, feature scaling, outliers)
- PCA transformation
- Clustering
- Compare segmentation results

## 4_dog_project
Build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Concepts
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN from scratch and transfer learning)

## 5_quadcopter
Design an agent to fly a quadcopter and then train it using a reinforcement learnign algorithm.

Concepts
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) - actor-crtic method

## practice_projects
Mini-projects completed through course lectures
